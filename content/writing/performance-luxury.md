A site cannot feel premium if it hesitates. I protect performance by keeping JavaScript optional. Most pages should be static, with progressive enhancement where the interface truly needs it.

I audit every dependency, removing anything that does not directly contribute to the story. I also measure layout shifts in the design phase, because the first impression is fragile.

When performance is treated as a material, the brand feels composed. The page responds instantly, letting the content be the main focus.
